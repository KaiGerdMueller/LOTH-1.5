</br>
**HOW TO PLAY** </br>
</br>
-> build a house and go mining.</br>
</br>
-> when you have enough gold and diamond, use them to trade with npcs.</br>
+-> right click with gold ingot : you obtain a key and the allowance to open ten chests in houses of the union of the one who you paid for. (unions are : orcs and human, dwarfs, elfs, hobbits)</br>
+-> right click with gold block/ diamond block (depending on npc type) : you hire the npc as soldier for some time. it will follow you everywhere. use magic whistles to heal it and suspend it from duty for some time (will dissapear).</br>
+-> build up a whole army this way.</br>
</br>
-> fight trolls with your army to obtain epic weapons.</br>
</br>
-> fight bosses with your army. do the final hit yourself, else the kill will not be counted as yours.</br>
</br>
-> when you killed every boss type at least once, sauron willappear and try to kill you. if you don't manage to kill him he will hunt you like this all the time.</br>
</br>
-> you find many bosses in the nether, craft a netherporter to go there.</br>
</br>
-> when you killed him (and only a player who killed (nearly) all other bosses can kill him, by chanche, with anything), he will drop the ring. don't die with the ring in inventory, or you loose it and sauron comes again ( like before ).</br>
</br>
-> craft an ulmo porter, teleport into ulmo, and drop the ring into the volcano in the center of ulmo.</br>
</br>
-> craft a raw magic wand, enchant it and make it an underworldporter. deal enough damage to underworld creatures to be allowed to use the melkor stave.</br>
</br>
-> enchant a stave creating a melkor stave.</br>
</br>
-> solve the rune riddle and go away, since melkor will spawn where you are standing right now soon.</br>
</br>
-> kill melkor. (like killing sauron, but melkor is worse)</br>
</br>
-> get the dropped grond, and have fun.</br>
</br>
-> you are now the only one who can use grond without taking damage.</br>
</br>
-> you can spawn melkor again if you're out for a challenge or want some monster for guarding your treasures.</br>

**CREDITS GO TO**</br>
</br>
the NPX team for NSSM : your really not so simple mobs are soooooooooooo many! and they are great for any medieval themed subgame!</br>
</br>
doomed (and TenPlus1, blert2112, and taikedz) for DMOBS : your mobs have great models and don't use any high level mob engine features so they where the first mobs i included in my subgame.</br>
i made my own mob engines, all mobs use my mob engines </br>
(because rewriting other mob engines to fit into my games systems would be O.O), </br>
but adapting my mob engine to dmobs was far more easy than adapting it to nssm! ;-)</br>
(and of course the dmobs are great for medieval themed subgames, too!)</br>
</br>
the minetest-game developers : a great basic subgame on top of wich one can build anything!!!</br>
</br>
the worldedit team : </br>
cheapie</br>
cornernote</br>
cyisfor</br>
electricface</br>
kaeza</br>
khonkhortisan</br>
sfan5</br>
ShadowNinja</br>
spillz</br>
Uberi/Temperest</br>
your tool is great for creating buildings quickly and saving schematics! aldough it is not installed in the subgame, it helped me a lot when i started creating trees and buildings!</br>
</br>
the ones who made the lott textures : these are simply great!</br>
</br>
see the readme/License & Purpose.txt files in each mod for more information.</br>
